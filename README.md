# Bugbook — Web Application

**Bugbook** is a structured knowledge system for developers and students to capture  
**concepts, bugs, mistakes, and project learnings** in a way that prioritizes  
**understanding and recall**, not just note storage.

It is built for people who learn by **thinking, writing, and revisiting** —  
not by dumping information into folders.

## Why use Bugbook?

Learning often fails not because of lack of effort, but because:

- Notes get scattered across folders and apps  
- Bugs and mistakes remain undocumented  
- Important insights fade with time  
- Revision becomes stressful and unstructured  

**Bugbook exists to fix this.**

It provides a calm, structured space to document:
- What you learned
- What confused you
- Why it works
- What to avoid next time
